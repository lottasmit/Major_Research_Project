# Major_Research_Project

This file contains 3 R scripts that were used during my internship at the Prinses Maxima Centrum. 
RNA&Ribo-seq_Analyses.Rmd was used to analyse RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data of 5 Ewing Sarcoma Cell lines with and without knockdown of the fusionprotein. 
EwS-specific_Neogenes_Analyses.Rmd was used to analyze the transcription and translation of 98 EwS-specific Neogenes, previously identified by my supervisor, in 5 EwS cell lines with vs without knock down. 
Col&countData.Rmd was used to load in the correct col & countData sets containing either RNA or Ribo-seq data of one or multiple cell lines to use in the analyses scripts.
